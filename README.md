## just a simple gameboy game i made in C

i made the sprite in [GBTD](http://www.devrs.com/gb/hmgd/gbtd.html)
and used the [GBDK](https://github.com/andreasjhkarlsson/gbdk-n) development kit 

the character just moves and prints cock on the screen when A is pressed

and that's it

### how to compile and run

simply just run the `make.bat` file to compile and run it using any gameboy emulator
i ran it with [BGB](https://bgb.bircd.org/) and RetroArch
